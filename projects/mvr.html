        into DB;
      </p>
      <p>
        - Motor Vehicle Registration - a service to enroll vehicles, people and
        organizations to the system, then its full life-cycle management and
        services;
      </p>
      <p>
        - Stock Control (Warehouse Management System) - 'Orders' component of
        the system, to manage stock and transfer/deliver products. Including a
        service for a whole chain of manager-picker-packer-deliver control and
